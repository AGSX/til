## Learning Python

**Date: April 24, 2016**

Over a sea of information about python, this TIL entry serves as a small curated guide on how to get started learning Python. Take on these tutorials in order:

1. [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book)
	- Estimated Duration: 1 week 
	- This tutorial was made by Zed Shaw, a guy who's also prominent in the Ruby community. Looking past the condescending tone and negative comments about Python 3, this tutorial is about learning discipline aside from learning Python.

2. [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/)
	- Estimated Duration: 1 week
	- This is an easy to chew Python 3 tutorial. Look past "Learn Python The Hard Way"'s negative view on Python 3 and actually start writing Python 3. Majority consent on the Zed Shaw's comments on Python 3 in "Learn Python The Hard Way" is outdated.

3. [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
	- Estimated Duration: 1-2 weeks
	- This gets deeper into data manipulation and working with CSV's, Data Frames and PDF's. After this you can probably translate your skills into writing Spark Jobs and scraping Datasets.

Once you've gone through these 3 tutorials you'll be ready to create your own libraries with Python 3.
