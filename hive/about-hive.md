Hive is non-relational database. It is a data warehouse layer built on top of Hadoop that simplifies analysis and queries. It takes polystructured and consists of metadata and hiveql.

Hive has SQL like language. It has support for most of the basic commands but lacks support for transactions and materialized view. It also has limited subquery support. Hive tables consists of data and schema. It also has support for multitable inserts. Data can be accessed with a simple query language and it supports overwriting of data.

It operates on the server-side of any cluster and it explicitly defines its schema before data is even acquired.
