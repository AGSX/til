# Basic SQLite

**Date: June 9, 2016**

SQLite is a relational database management system like Postgres and MySQL that is designed to be simple and easy to set up. However, this provides drawbacks such as limited configurability.

Using SQLite over *heavier* database management systems may be beneficial in the following situations:
- Training
- Embedded systems
- Prototypes or other temporary databases
- Cache for enterprise data

Some well-known applications/systems that use SQLite include:
- Adobe Lightroom
- Firefox (in the web browser)
- Thunderbird
- Google (Chrome and Android)
- Microsoft Windows 10
- McAfee
